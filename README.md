## Proxy Unblocker Template (by Universe)

This is a template to unblock any specific website. Works 99.99% percent of the time, except for specific iframe games.

> ### Instructions
> Deploy to the site of your choice (replit, vercel, or render) log in and all that.
> Go back to github and go to whatever you named your repo and go to index.js and then click the pencil (edit)
> Change the "https://example.com" to whatever the site you wish to unblock to. Then visit the url and enjoy!
